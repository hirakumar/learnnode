                comment:"We have nothing but praise for Puru. He arranged our month-long trip accommodation for all our requests with efficiency and attention to every detail. The visit to his home villages of Pursuk was the highlight of our stay. The people were warm and very friendly. We felt so welcome and saw real Nepalese life. Our guide Dhurba Bista and Our Porter Basu Duwadi were always courteous and friendly. We are in our 60?s and they were both most patient and helpful. At the end of our trek, we regarded them as our Nepali Sons! Thanks, Puru for a fantastic vacation",
